# Home Affordability Calculator

Looking for your next home on Zillow is fun, but knowing whether you can afford
it can be difficult. *What are my total monthly payments including mortgage,
taxes, insurance, and private schools? Do I make enough money to sustain these
payments and keep saving for the future?*

While the exact guidance might be specific to each home buyer, there are some
simple rules of thumb to make the process easier. One popular metric is the
[28% rule](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/twenty-eight-thirty-six-rule.asp),
which says that no more than 28% of gross household income (income before taxes)
should go to housing expenses.

I found myself recalculating the 28% rule a couple of times per year, and
tinkering with different inputs (home prices, interest rates, etc.). I built
this tool to make home buying analysis faster, and it gave me an opportunity to
get some reps with javascript and HTML.
