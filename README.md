# Home Affordability Calculator

Looking for your next home on Zillow is fun, but knowing whether you can afford
it can be difficult. *What are my total monthly payments including mortgage,
taxes, insurance, and private schools? Do I make enough money to sustain these
payments and keep saving for the future?*

While the exact guidance might be specific to each home buyer, there are some
simple rules of thumb to make the process easier. One popular metric is the
[28% rule](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/twenty-eight-thirty-six-rule.asp),
which says that no more than 28% of gross household income (income before taxes)
should go to housing expenses.

I found myself recalculating the 28% rule a couple of times per year, and
tinkering with different inputs (home prices, interest rates, etc.). I built
this tool to make home buying analysis faster, and it gave me an opportunity to
get some reps with javascript and HTML.

Let me know if anything else should be added

## A working Example

Alice and Bob are in the market for a new home. They found a house on Redfin for
**$850k**. They are pre-approved for a 30-year loan at a **2.9% interest rate**,
and plan to make an initial **20% down payment**.

The **property taxes on the home are 1%**, and **home insurance will cost
$1200/yr**.

Both Alice and Bob are employed, and their **gross yearly income (before taxes and
deductions) is $210k**.

Alice and Bob populate the information into the *Home Affordability Calculator*
and determine that after their **down payment of $170k**, they will have a
**monthly payment (which includes principle, interest, taxes, and insurance) of
$3683.70**.

That seems like a lot of money, but it accounts for only **20.8% of their
income**, safely below the recommended ceiling of 28%.
